# LSTM model with leave-site-out cross-validation on a single continent,
# This script extracts the data for America and Europe
# and trains the LSTM model on sites from a given continent at a time.

# TODO: Implement the separation of sites into continents. Beni wanted to keep Australia
# out of both groups.
